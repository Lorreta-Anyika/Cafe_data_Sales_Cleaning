## Project Overview  
This project involved cleaning and analyzing a **messy sales dataset** containing **10,000 rows and 8 columns**.  
The dataset had **missing values, errors, and inconsistent formats**. Using **Microsoft Excel**, I transformed it into a structured format and created meaningful insights through **interactive dashboards**.

## Data Source  
The dataset was obtained from **Kaggle** and contains **sales transactions** with the following fields:  
- **Transaction Date**  
- **Product Name**  
- **Sales Quantity**  
- **Revenue**  
- **Customer Type**  
- **Payment Method**  
- **Store Location**  
- **Order Type (Takeaway/In-store)**  

The dataset contained **missing values, "UNKNOWN" and "ERROR" entries, and inconsistent date formats**, requiring extensive cleaning.  

## Tools Used  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: **Microsoft Excel**  
- **Data Visualization**: **PivotTables, PivotCharts**  
- **Download Excel** (if you don’t have it): [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)  

## Data Cleaning and Preparation  
The cleaning process involved:  

### 1. Data Loading and Inspection  
- Imported the dataset into Excel  
- Scanned for missing values and inconsistencies  

### 2. Handling Missing Values  
- Used **Find & Replace (Ctrl + H)** to clean "UNKNOWN" and "ERROR"  
- Applied **IFS and LOOKUP formulas** to fill missing values:  
  ```excel
  =IF(B2<>"", B2, LOOKUP(2, 1/(B3:B100<>""), B3:B100))
This ensures empty cells are filled with the nearest available value.  

### 3. Fixing Date Formats  
Extracted months as text instead of numbers:  

```excel
=TEXT(A2, "mmm")   // Displays "Jan, Feb, Mar..."
=TEXT(A2, "mmmm")  // Displays "January, February, March..."
```
### 4. Avoiding #REF! Errors
Used structured table references instead of direct cell references.

### 5. PivotTable Copy-Paste Issues
Used **PivotTable Analyze → Select → Entire PivotTable → Copy → Paste**.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain insights, I explored key business questions:

1. Which products sell the most?
2. Which products generate the highest revenue?
3. Are there seasonal trends in sales?
4. What is the preferred payment method among customers?
5. Are customers buying more takeaway or dining in-store?
6. What product combinations are frequently bought together?

## Data Analysis 
All data analysis was conducted using **PivotTables** in Excel. The PivotTables helped answer key business questions by:  

- **Summarizing sales by product** to identify bestsellers  
- **Grouping sales by revenue** to see which items generated the most profit  
- **Analyzing seasonal trends** by breaking down sales by month  
- **Counting transactions by payment method** to determine customer preferences  
- **Comparing takeaway vs. dine-in sales** to understand ordering habits

## PivotCharts & Interactive Dashboard  

After analyzing the data with **PivotTables**, I created an **interactive dashboard** to enhance visualization and user experience.  

### **Charts Used & Why?**  

- **Bar Chart** 📊 → To rank **top-selling products** by sales volume.  
- **Column Chart** 📉 → To compare **revenue generated by different products**.  
- **Line Chart** 📈 → To identify **seasonal sales trends** over time.  
- **Pie Chart** 🍕 → To show the **distribution of payment methods** (Digital Wallets vs. Cash).  
- **Treemap Chart** 🔲 → To visualize the **most popular product categories** at a glance.  

### **Dashboard Features & Enhancements**  

I refined the dashboard for **better usability and interactivity** using:  

✅ **Slicers** 🎛️ – Added slicers for **Product Category, Month, and Payment Method** to filter data easily.  
✅ **Timeline** ⏳ – Used a timeline to **analyze sales trends over time** with dynamic date selection.  
✅ **Conditional Formatting** 🎨 – Highlighted key values to make **important insights stand out**.  
✅ **Color Themes** 🎨 – Applied **consistent branding** for a **professional look and easy readability**.  
✅ **Dynamic Layout** 📊 – Ensured **charts update automatically** when filters are applied.

By integrating **PivotCharts with an interactive dashboard**, I transformed raw data into **a clear, visually appealing report** that enables **quick decision-making and trend analysis**. 🚀  


## Results & Findings
- Juice vs. Salad: Juice had more sales, but salads generated higher revenue.
- Customer Preferences: More customers preferred takeaways over in-store dining.
- Payment Trends: Digital wallets dominated over cash or card payments.
- Seasonal Trends: Sales spiked towards the end of the year, indicating a holiday effect.

## Recommendations
1. Promote high-revenue items (like salads) while ensuring top-selling items remain available.
2. Optimize delivery & packaging for takeaway orders to meet customer demand.
3. Enhance digital payment systems to improve transaction efficiency.
4. Plan marketing campaigns ahead of peak seasons to maximize sales.

## Limitations
- Dataset only includes sales transactions—no information on customer demographics for deeper insights.
- Some missing values were assumed based on the nearest available data.
- Findings may not be generalizable across all industries or businesses.
